## 类型

`链表`

## 思路及代码

### 个人思路

A链表和B链表同时出发，当其中一个到达末尾时，转换到另一个链表的头部。这样可以消除两个链表之间的差距。

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        current_a, current_b = headA, headB
        distance = 0
        while current_a and current_b:
            current_a = current_a.next
            current_b = current_b.next
        if not current_a:
            while current_b:
                current_b = current_b.next
                distance += 1
            current_a = headA
            current_b = headB
            for i in range(distance):
                current_b = current_b.next
        else:
            while current_a:
                current_a = current_a.next
                distance += 1
            current_a = headA
            current_b = headB
            for i in range(distance):
                current_a = current_a.next
        while current_a and current_b and current_a != current_b:
            current_a = current_a.next
            current_b = current_b.next
        return current_a
        
```
